new topic.

ive created a new view in our app.

its called ladderboard view, and obviously it should have a ladder board.
in ourdjango html templatei want to present the users from highest to lowest rank 

however id like to implement a sort of rebouncing like before, but in this case, we use bootstrap 5.3 lists and  pagination
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/pagination/

the rebouncing ideia would be to, on the first request, render only the first page with lets say, 5 elements,
and only after that do requests for the following pages,
this way we would have to query the whole user base at once.
