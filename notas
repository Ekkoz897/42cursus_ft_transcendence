A ladder tournament (also known as a ladder competition or pyramid tournament) 
is a form of tournament for games and sports. Unlike many tournaments, 
which usually have an element of elimination, ladder competitions can go on indefinitely. 
In a ladder competition, players are listed as if on the rungs of a ladder.
